# JJLang #

This is an automated Java converter from Java Language to any other target. Code is self-explanatory if one is aware of ANTLRv3 related project and beyond. Code is based on many developers' work, especially of ANTLR community. Underling principle is to have Java grammar which is used for basic scanning and parsing, and after that to exploit Generator grammar (TreeWalker) together with respective StringTemplateGroup of a target language.

## Notes ##
  * It looks like this is exactly the opposite problem solved by one commercial tool called ["nTile PtoJ from Numiton"](http://www.numiton.com/products/ntile-ptoj/ptoj-overview.html)
